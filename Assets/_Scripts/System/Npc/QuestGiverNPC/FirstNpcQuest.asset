  - "Ah, here\u2019s our new worker\u2026 \nGood to see you. \nEver since you set
    foot in this village, everyone\u2019s been talking about you."
  - "They say you survived a shipwreck. \nBut when I heard your story, I couldn\u2019t
    help but wonder."
  - "I couldn't stop thinking about how did you manage to survive with such a small
    boat and limited supplies? \nPeople here in this village know a thing or two
    about survival, but your story... it\u2019s curious."
  - "I hope you're as hardworking as you are mysterious. \nWe gave you a job at the
    market. Meet our expectations, help the villagers. \nAnd remember, if anything
    happens, I won\u2019t hesitate to go to the Headman. \nNow, off you go. Do your
    work. We\u2019ll be watching."
