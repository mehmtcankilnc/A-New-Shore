  - "Hey there! \nWho are you? Where did you come from? \nThat boat of yours looks
    like it\u2019s seen better days."
  - "A shipwreck? Poor soul! Are you hungry? \nLet me get you some water or food."
  - "So, what is it that you do? \nYou can\u2019t survive here on your own. Do you
    need help?"
  - "Hmm... Alright. \nWe could use some help at the market. You\u2019ll deliver
    customers' orders. \nBut remember, honesty is vital in this village. I\u2019ll
    be keeping an eye on you."

    gone. \nI\u2019m the only one left. I\u2019ve been drifting for days."
  - "Yes, please... \nI\u2019m starving. I haven\u2019t eaten in days. I would be
    so grateful."

  comebackChat: 'Oh, you''re still around. By now, I thought you would run away.

    You
    look tired, I forgot to mention that the job I gave you is exhausting, right?

    You
    better keep working if you wanna stay here!'
